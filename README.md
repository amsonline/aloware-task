## About the task
Inside this repository you can find a single-page commenting system. APIs are provided using Laravel and the front-end is made by Vue.js.

## Starting guide
After cloning the repository and setting database values, run
```php artisan migrate```

following by

```php artisan serve```

and open the url http://localhost:8000

## Descriptions
There is no need to register/login to be able to comment. There is no actual post, either. At the page, you will find a static Lorem Ipsum post alongside with the ability to comment.
Each comment can be replied up to 3 levels. The third level does not have the Reply button, and if any user, by any way, tries to call the API to add a comment for more than 3 levels, this is being checked server-side, too.

Two APIs are used in this project:
* ```GET /api/comments```
This API is called once when the page loads, to get all comments. Comments are returned as threaded.

* ```POST /api/comments```
This API is called whenever someone posts a comment. It will return all comments of the post (to update the other comments other users maybe sent between page load and posting the comment).

The front-end is created using Vue.js (as mentioned earlier) and some Bootstrap classes were used, although it was not part of the task.

The comments are stored inside Vuex store, so it is globally accessible from the application.

Also, all tests are placed at ```CommentTest``` class. You can run ```php artisan test``` to test all test cases.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
